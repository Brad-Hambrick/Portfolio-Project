        <p id="aboutme">
            My name is Brad Hambrick and I am currently a student in the Vanderbilt
            Coding Bootcamp.  I worked in Law Enforcement for ten years and decided that 
            I needed a change.  That change found me.  I randomly came across an add for this 
            bootcamp and began looking at what coding was and it became an addiction.  Every new
            piece of knowledge that I gained sparked a yearning for more.  So I have decided to
            commit my life to this and I am having alot of fun with it.  I have included several 
            projects that I have been working on and I would love for you to see them.  Please 
            look around and enjoy! 
          </p>
